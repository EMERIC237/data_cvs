# Instructions to Generate Fake Documents

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python**: You need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Required Libraries**: You also need to have the `pandas` and `faker` libraries installed. You can install them by opening your terminal (or command prompt) and running the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas faker
    ```

## Steps to Generate Fake Documents

Follow these steps to generate fake documents:

1. **Create a Python Script**: Copy the provided code and paste it into a new file. Save this file as `generate_fake_documents.py`.

2. **Run the Script**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `generate_fake_documents.py` using the `cd` command, and run the script by executing the following command:
    ```sh
    python generate_fake_documents.py
    ```

3. **Check the Output**: After the script has finished running, you will find two new files in the same directory: `fake_mixed_documents_70k.json` and `fake_mixed_documents_70k.csv`.
