# Issue Analysis: Personalized Parameters Undefined on Subsequent Searches

## Overview

Users experience an issue where personalized search parameters such as Line of Business (LOB), COUNTRY, and taxonomy are not retained after the initial search. While the first search correctly populates and displays these parameters, subsequent searches show them as undefined, despite successful network calls.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the home page of the application.
2. Perform a search using personalized parameters (LOB, COUNTRY, taxonomy).
3. Observe that the parameters are correctly populated and displayed.
4. Return to the home page.
5. Perform a second search.
6. Observe that the parameters now appear as undefined.

## Expected vs. Actual Behavior

- **Expected Behavior:** Personalized parameters should be consistently populated and displayed correctly for every search performed, regardless of the number of times the user returns to the home page.
- **Actual Behavior:** Personalized parameters are correctly populated during the first search but appear as undefined on subsequent searches after returning to the home page.

## Investigation

### Network Call Observation

The network call responsible for retrieving the personalized parameters returns the correct values every time, including during the subsequent searches when the parameters appear undefined.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from a function call `deconstructOldUrl(searchParams.get('query'))` on the search page, which attempts to extract LOB, COUNTRY, and taxonomy from the URL parameters. Since these values are not included in the URL sent from the home page, they are always undefined.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Identify the Affected Function

Locate the function `deconstructOldUrl(searchParams.get('query'))` in the codebase where the search parameters are being deconstructed.

### 2. Remove Faulty Logic

Remove the logic that attempts to extract LOB, COUNTRY, and taxonomy from the URL parameters in the `deconstructOldUrl` function.

### 3. Update Parameter Retrieval

Implement logic to retrieve LOB, COUNTRY, and taxonomy from cookies or the ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) call instead of the URL.

### Code Modification

```javascript
// Remove this part
const lob = deconstructOldUrl(searchParams.get('lob'));
const country = deconstructOldUrl(searchParams.get('country'));
const taxonomy = deconstructOldUrl(searchParams.get('taxonomy'));

// Add this part
const lob = getFromCookiesOrADFS('lob');
const country = getFromCookiesOrADFS('country');
const taxonomy = getFromCookiesOrADFS('taxonomy');

// Function to get values from cookies or ADFS
function getFromCookiesOrADFS(param) {
    // Logic to retrieve the parameter from cookies
    const valueFromCookies = getCookie(param);
    if (valueFromCookies) {
        return valueFromCookies;
    }

    // Logic to retrieve the parameter from ADFS
    const valueFromADFS = getADFSParameter(param);
    if (valueFromADFS) {
        return valueFromADFS;
    }

    return undefined;
}

4. Testing
Thoroughly test the application to ensure that the personalized parameters are correctly populated and displayed during subsequent searches.
Ensure that the parameters are retrieved correctly from cookies or ADFS as expected.
5. Code Review
Have another developer review the changes to ensure correctness and adherence to coding standards.

6. Deployment
Deploy the changes to the staging environment and conduct end-to-end testing to verify the fix.
Once confirmed, deploy the changes to the production environment.
By following these steps, the issue with the personalized parameters being undefined on subsequent searches should be resolved, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience. ```
